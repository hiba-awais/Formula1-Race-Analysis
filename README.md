# Formula1-Race-Analysis
Formula 1 race analysis and Monte Carlo simulation to estimate drivers' championship probabilities using Python and Tableau

## Project Overview 
This project uses Python and the FastF1 library to analyze Formula 1 race data and model the probability of a driver winning the World Driver's Championship (WDC). 
The workflow involves collecting and cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis, and preparing results for visualization in Tableau. 

## Features 
* Automated data collection using the FastF1's API services
* Data cleaning and merging from multiple sources
* Computation of fastest laps, average lap time per stint, and driver consistency
* Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate WDC probabilities
* Data export to Tableau to create interactive, visual dashboards
