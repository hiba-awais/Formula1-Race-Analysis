# Formula 1 Monte Carlo Simulation by Hiba Awais 
# October 6, 2025 

# A simulation for the probability an given driver can win the current season given the current points
# standings, race win probabilities per drivers, and track intensities 
# Note: The data used is based on assumptions, but this program can be modified to analyze based on historical 
# data. All current driver information is based on Oct 6, 2025.
